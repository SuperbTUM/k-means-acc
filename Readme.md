## Introduction

This is my graduation project. The goal of this individual work is to design and implement a general acceleration algorithm for k-means clustering with the assistance of GPU. I'd like to name it as hybrid method. Frankly speaking, it is a kind of algorithm that integrates all possible acceleration modules that I can think of, including PCA as dataset pretreatment. To test the algorithm, I set traditional k-means algorithm (Lloyd, 1982) as well as triangle inequality algorithm (Elkan, 2006) as references. I leveraged Adjust Rand Index and Adjust Normalization Index as accuracy functions and linear speedup as algorithm speed evaluation function.

Once we have the methodology, we need to write a demo to test it quantitatively. The following table shows basic information of the dataset for experiment. The URL for dataset download is: https://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/kddcup99/kddcup99.html

| name                      | parameter                |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| dataset                   | kdd-cup 1999 (corrected) |
| feature number            | 41                       |
| original cluster number   | 23                       |
| simplified cluster number | 5                        |

## Quick start

For a quick start, you can merely alter file path whenever you want to test the dataset (commonly in csv or txt format)  and set your desired cluster number, then click 'run'. 

You can test acceleration algorithm with GPU in final_hmz_new.ipynb, but make sure you do have CUDA in your computer. Also, you need to check compute capability of your GPU.

Moreover, I design a simple GUI. However, it is a na√Øve one. For those who want to embedd the algorithm into a software, you can try to put more effort on it.

## Something else I want to say

For us Chinese learners, if we are asked to write some code, we are likely to turn to the Internet (mostly CSDN for startup learners) for help as our first step. I won't contend this is inappropriate because this can help to complete our tasks quicker, but learning is not always copying from others without understanding what the code writer is thinking at that moment and assessing the correctness of the referenced code. This is not to demand everyone to become an expert, this is to encourage everyone to become critical, to be vigilant towards latent bugs, since certain bugs may lead to fatal errors under massive and exhaustive tests.
